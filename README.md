# Beer Brewing Simulator Mod
This Mod is called: Beer Brewing Simulator.
And that's exactly what it is. If you are a homebrewer you are familiar with the various calculations of abv, ibu, og, fg, srm, and etc.
With this mod you can play and test with 137 types of hops and 7 types of liquid malt extracts.
The result of the process of fermentation will be a keg containing all final numbers of your beer.

List of Attributes Calculated:
 - ABV (Alcohol by Volume)
 - IBU (International Bitterness Unit)
 - SRM (Standard Reference Method)
 - Lovibond Index
 - Original Gravity
 - Final Gravity

 Current known limitations:
 - Batch and Boild: For now we have fixed the Batch size and Boil Size for 5 gallons.
 - Extract Method: All recipes are based on Extract Method.
 - LME: Only Liquid Malts are available for now.
 - OneHop: One Type of hops per fermentation.

It's being developed by rafacost3d, for Minecraft 1.12.2
